# ZtM-Workouts
A project with a variety of exercises that will help you learn development.
### Idea
Complementary excercises for practising web development and the ZtM course.
Not a list of resources, but a library of excercises!
Add excercises for each category: html, css, js, react, testing, etc...
They could then have a button that will show you the solution.
If you have any good ideas feel free to add them!
