# ZtM-Workouts
A project with a variety of exercises that will help you learn development.
### Idea
Complementary exercises for practising web development and the ZtM course.
Not a list of resources, but a library of exercises!
Add exercises for each category: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Testing, etc...
They could then have a button that will show the solution.
If you have any good ideas feel free to add them!
